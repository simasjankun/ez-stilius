Over more than fifteen years, I've created not only in Lithuania but also in Norway — where I spent several years perfecting my craft and learning from the Scandinavian knitting tradition.\n\nBut I always wanted more. In 2020–2021, I learned the fundamentals of sewing at Dygsnis courses, and from 2021 to 2023, I completed a professional seamstress qualification at the Klaipėda Technology Training Centre. In 2023, I participated in an international seamstress craftsmanship competition and won first place. It was a confirmation that I was on the right path."
